      <h2>About RentDrive</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>RentDrive</strong> is a modern car rental and ride management platform designed to connect 
        users with reliable drivers in their city while empowering organizations to manage their fleet and 
        drivers seamlessly. Our goal is to simplify the way people book rides and how companies handle 
        transportation operations — efficiently, transparently, and securely.

      <p>
        RentDrive brings together three types of users — <strong>Riders</strong>, <strong>Drivers</strong>, and 
        <strong>Organizations</strong> — each playing a key role in the booking process.
